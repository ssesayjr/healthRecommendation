# Exploratory Analysis of Populace Health and Recommendation 

Individualizing nutritional advice for a unique person is quite difficult in 2020. There are a multitude of downloadable applications, web services and personal trainers that offer advice, but this information is based on the average populace. Also there is an innate assumption that a person can either afford a nutitional coach, or has the access to mobile applications and web services. According to Statista only 45% of the world has access to a smartphone; and World Bank has reported that 10% of the global population lives below the international poverty line. Unfortunately, health afflictions are indiscriminate of smartphone access and more incline to those without access to proper nutritional supplements. If an individual receives medical advice, notifying them of definicts in macro nurtrients, they are prescribed different foods that can increase those nutrients; regardless of the accessibility, income level, and market value of that good. This project proposes to build a recommendation stystem that takes into account several factors (including individual health) and provide suggestions to improve the quality of a persons eating habit/nutritional deficit.

Objective: Create a model that provides nutritional deficit individuals with dietary suggestions based on environment and cost.
